<h1><u><b>Project Overview</b></u></h1>

For the software engineering project i was assigned to the semester tracker project where or goal was to make a application that you would be able to login and view all of the infomation about a semester eg(start/end date,hoildays,assignment dates)

<h1><u><b>Timeline</b></u></h1>

<u><b>Week 1</b></u>

For the first week I got assigned to the semester tracker project and the first thing that we did as a group was to create a git page and decide on what would be the best way to communicate with each other.
Following that we me with the first client and got some file from the previous attempt of the project and a list of current errors that we add to our bug tracking software


<u><b>Week 2</b></u>
We started the week by reviewing the files that had been given to us so that we could figure out how we were going tackle the project. After looking at the files that we were given we thought it would be best to recreate the whole thing from scratch.
We also setup a meeting with our other client to discuss what they wanted from the project.


<u><b>Week 3</b></u>
We started the third week by having the meeting with the client that we had setup the previous we
The second client we went to see told us what he wanted out of the project giving us more user stories to work towards.
The last thing we decided on was the technology that we were going to use, we got suggested to use a framework called YII and after considering it we decided to try and learn how to use it.

<u><b>Holidays - 2 weeks</b></u>

Over the holidays the task was to lookup the YII framework to try and understand how it works and what is does. 


<u><b>Week 4</b></u>

After we got back from the holidays the first thing we did was meet and discuss what we did and compare understandings of how YII worked.
We also discussed the tasks that we were all going to do over the next week or two.

<u><b>Week 5</b></u>

At the start of the week Jordan made some mock diagrams of how the database was going to look and gave it to me so I could create the first working version that would be integrated into the site.

<u><b>Week 6</b></u>

I changed from working on the database and went to making the management pages for the fields that needed to be edited/deleted/created/searching by a staff or admin. When I started working on the pages I was told that there was an extension for YII that would generate the pages that I needed so I spent the rest of the week learning how to use the GII extension.

<u><b>Week 7</b></u>

The week started by using the GII extension to make all the pages that we need to manage the data. After creating the pages, I tested the pages and had to change some of the data input fields to match the required input

<u><b>Week 8</b></u>

assisted on the ticket system

<u><b>Week 9</b></u>

Over the week I worked on adding permissions to the main page to only allow user to see the different page tabs on the navigation bar based on the permission level that they have.

<u><b>Week 10</b></u>

After working on the permissions for the users over the last week I noticed that user could still get to the pages through the URL so I went and made a set of permissions for each page that checked what permissions the user had and then redirecting them to the page or an access denied/please sign in screen that I made after improving the permissions system.

<u><b>Week 11</b></u>

At the start of the week we got some data from one of the clients in a different format then what we had made the database so that meant changes had to be made to the database as well as updating all the tables with the correct fields. so, I spent the rest of the week working on recreating and updating the management pages.

<u><b>Week 12</b></u>

This was the final week we worked on the project by fixing little bug and finish up on the current ticket we were working on to
